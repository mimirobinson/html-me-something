    <h1>Lagos, Nigeria.  WTH?</h1>

    <article>
        <p>I moved to Lagos, Nigeria for the second time in August 2009. My husband
            joined me almost a year later in July 2010. While we had amazing experiences
            traveling outside of Nigeria, I want to focus on my favorite places and
            experiences within Nigeria.<p>
        <p> A few interesting facts about Nigeria. It's actually named The Federal
            Republic of Nigeria. It has 36 states and a population of about 184 million.
             It is the world's 20th largest economy and the paper currency of
             Nigeria is the Naira (&#8358;).  H/T: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria"

        <h2>The Nigerian Wedding (Lagos, Nigeria)</h2>
        <p>After my husband Martesee and I returned from the US for our wedding, my
        coworkers decided to throw us a traditional wedding.  They went FULL out!
        They had our wedding outfits made and had someone one had to tie my gele,
        the large and elaborate head wrap. <p>
        <p>Everyone came dressed in aso ebi, which is when the wedding attendees
        come dressed in the same material to show solidarity. They had drummers,
        a DJ, food, drinks and a cake. </p>
        <p>It was the single most nicest thing a group of people has ever done for
        me and something neither my husband nor I will ever forget.</p>

        <h2>Nike Centre for Arts &amp; Culture (Osogbo, Nigeria)</h2>
        <p>Chief Oyenike Okundaye is a professional textile artist and painter dedicated
            to preserving traditional and modern art in Nigeria.  She offers tours of her
        hometown where you can see the process of Yoruba textile production.

        <p> On this visit, an elder recounted my history to me and in the evening we
        were able to watch and participate in a tradition music and dance performance.</p>

        <h2>Osun-Osogbo Sacred Grove (Osogbo, Nigera)</h2>
        <p>This is absolutely my favorite place in Nigeria.  It is located by the
        Osun River and is said to be the abode of the goddess of fertility Oshun,
        a Yoruba goddess. It is beautiful, quiet and has this spiritual
        peacefulness that made me want to stay longer. I would definitely return.</p>
